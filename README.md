| [Task 1](./lab_1/) | Implement asynchronous array methods (map, filter, find, etc.) and add on-demand features              |
| [Task 2](./lab_2/)  | Create Promise-based alternatives, write usage examples with Promise and async/await                  |
| [Task 3](./lab_3/)  | Implement AbortController or other cancellable approaches                                             |
| [Task 4](./lab_4/)  | Process large data sets that don't fit in memory (Streams, AsyncIterator, or alternatives)            |
| [Task 5](./lab_5/)  | Implement reactive communication systems (Observable, EventEmitter, or alternatives)                  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Tasks  
### Task 1: Asynchronous Array Methods  
- Choose an array method (e.g., map, filter, find).  
- Implement its asynchronous counterpart.  
- Prepare demo cases for usage.  

### Task 2: Promise-based Alternatives  
- Implement Promise-based alternatives for methods from Task 1.  
- Write usage examples:  
  - Using Promises.  
  - Using async/await.  
- **On-demand feature:** Add support for parallelism.  

### Task 3: Cancellation Implementation  
- Implement `AbortController` or other cancellable approaches for task cancellation.  

### Task 4: Processing Large Data  
- Use Streams, AsyncIterator, or their alternatives for processing large datasets that don't fit in memory.  

### Task 5: Reactive Systems  
- Implement reactive communication systems using `Observable`, `EventEmitter`, or their alternatives.
